# GlobalQuakeServer

GlobalQuake server is the next step in GlobalQuake development and it will allow multiple clients to connect and share 
the same processed data without the need to connect to seedlink servers locally nor running the intensive hypocenter finding algorithms on your PC's

Unfortunately, due to various reasons, including the frequent overloading of Seedlink providers' servers, GlobalQuake server releases for the public have been discontinued.

Thank you for your support and understanding.
